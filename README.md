### Project Name

---

Our project is called Echoes of Absence. The title was chosen to reflect the lingering echoes in our minds left by the loss of someone dear to us.

### Project Description

---

Why is it that when we lose someone dear to us we can not resist looking for ways to celebrate their life? Our project, a short film hosted on the web, aims to breathe life into this very question. Taking advantage of the flexibility the web technology offers, we have also incorporated some interactive components to the experience.

Thematically, we wanted to focus on grief. How losing someone dear impacts us in our day to day life, and how we look for ways to overcome the grief by paying some sort of tribute to the departed person. The main concept of this project is to address grief, show that grief is a normal emotion. Through the story of our main character's journey with grief, the film aims to subtly inspire viewers and bridge the gap for those feeling alienated by their own grief.

The whole experience we wanted to create was for the viewer to feel incrementally increasing sympathy for the young man. By the end of the experience, the user would feel much more comfortable dealing with grief and feel more sympathetic towards those around them going through grief.

### Process

---

We started the creative process by talking about what types of ideas are best expressed in the video medium. Our conversation took us to another route, where we ended up talking about how grief is an extremely powerful emotion. Realizing this detour our conversation took, we chose to explore how grief impacts an individual, using the video medium to both illustrate and conceptualize this experience. Ultimately, we decided to create a short silent film that portrays the process of dealing with grief, emphasizing its normalcy and universality.

Once we finalized the concept and type of project, we began crafting the screenplay and developing the shot lists. We created a story about a young man who lost his father in a war and is deeply affected by grief. This huge loss impacts every single aspect of his daily life, from his studies to his relationships. His struggle continues until he decides to pay tribute to his father, which helps him move forward, even if just slightly. Utilizing his skills in design and graffiti, he creates a magnum opus -- a grand graffiti portrait of his late father.

Then we decided on what types of interactivity on the web our project should have. Aside from making our website feel alive and well suited to the story, we wanted to leverage the web technology and incorporate the powerful `p5.js` library to help the viewers feel as if they are part of the story. We designed a feature that allows users to engage directly with the story by adding their own graffiti to the artwork created by the main character. This interactive element transforms our website into a canvas, inviting users to contribute to the evolving graffiti piece. The users are also given the choice to download what they have created on the canvas into their devices.

The filming itself was a challenging process as no member of our group had any experience with operating cameras for film aside from the workshop we had in class. This project had the steepest learning curve for all of us. Despite these challenges, we collaborated effectively and successfully captured every shot we envisioned. For post-production, we used Davinci Resolve to edit the footage into a coherent film. Throughout the editing process, we were guided by principles from Walter Murch's "In the Blink of an Eye." We focused on using editing techniques not only to enhance the emotional impact of each scene but also to advance the narrative smoothly and maintain a consistent rhythm. Additionally, we employed color grading to align the visual tone with the emotional context of each scene, further immersing the audience in the story's emotional landscape. We

After we finished shooting and editing, we moved onto sound editing to accompany the visual experience. ...

After getting done with the film as a whole and hosting the film on YouTube, we started designing the website and coding the interactive elements of the webpage. We first created an overarching theme for the website, then divided the work up. After getting done with the individual pages, we merged the work and ensured that they are integrating smoothly and fitting the overarching theme.

Last but not least, we deployed the whole project on the web.
